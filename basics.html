          <p>Overleaf (this is not a feature of LaTeX itself) provides you with a variety of templates to use for a variety of different types of projects. Click <b>View All</b> to see even more.</p>
          <p>If you're unsure about what type of format you want or prefer to make your own, a "Blank Project" will give you the framework for a very simple document.</p>

        <div class="body_p">
          <p>The first line defines the <b>type of document</b>; within the preceding brackets <b>font size</b> (in pt) and <b>paper size</b> (a4paper, legalpaper, and letterpaper) can be adjusted as well. The default font size is 10pt and the default paper size is letterpaper (8.5' x 11').</p>
          <p>The second line defines the <b>encoding. In general, don't touch this</b>. In the lines after, <b>import the packages you are going to use</b>. If you plan on using images use the "graphicx" package and provide a graphics path if you plan to have the images in sub-directories.</p>
          <p>The lines after package imports are used to define the title, author, and date. The "thanks" commands can be used to include names of those who helped in footnotes. The "today" command will update the date to the current date each time the document is compiled.</p>
          <p>To start printing words on the document, begin a "document" environment; use the <b>"maketitle"</b> command to print the title, author, and date, and the <b>"tableofcontents"</b> command to create a table of contents which automatically updates each time you recompile.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you may make an <b>abstract</b>, which is used to introduce or briefly overview the main topic of the paper.</p>

          <p>To incorporate images in your documents, use the package <b>graphicx</b> and upload the images to Overleaf.</p>
          <p>Click the triple dots to the right of your main.tex. You can upload from your computer files or import from any other existing Overleaf project you have.</p>
          <p>Use the command <b>graphicspath</b> to specify the folder of your images. If your images are on the root level, you do not need to use this command.</p>
          <p>The basic command for using an image is</p>

          <p>An environment can be used for more features.</p>
          <p>The first image to use a caption will be captioned "Figure 1:", followed by your text. Each following image with a caption will increment in its figure number by one.</p>
          <p>With the <b>label</b> command, you can assign an image a name to refer to its figure number easily. In addition to helping you and readers to quickly find an image, this also helps if the figure number changes frequently (due to adding images before it).</p>

        <div class="title">3: Helpful Things I Should've Explained Earlier</div>
        <div class="body_p">
          <ol>
            <li>The <b>begin</b> and <b>end</b> commands begin and end an environment, respectively. An environment indicates how the text within it should be presented on the document. <br> <b>Helpful environments:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>document</li>
                <li>figure</li>
                <li>math</li>
                <li>itemize (unordered list)</li>
                <li>enumerate (ordered list)</li>
                <li>tabular (table)</li>
                <li>center</li>
                <li>equation (centers equation and italicizes its variables on new line)</li>
                <li>verbatim</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Parameters in brackets are optional.</li>
            <li><b>Multiple instances of white space are ignored.</b> For instance, if there are two spaces between two words, the compiled text will only show one space between the words. This is the same for new lines. This helps if you make mistakes :)</li>
            <li>Similarly to point 3, how you use white space to organize your source code does not affect the compiled text or its ability to compile.</li>
            <li>Use the two arrows between the source text to jump to the text on the other side. You can also double click a part in the compiled text to jump to its location in the source text.</li>
            <li>Reference math inline by surrounding the math text with a dollar sign on each side. Display math in a different line or section by using the environment <b>displaymath</b>.</li>
            <li>You can generally write a symbol by using a backslash followed by its name (\pi). When using math symbols outside a math environment, surround the symbol with dollar signs ($\pi$). </li>
            <li><b>Make comments with percentage symbols.</b> %Like this!</li>
            <li>Your file outline is at the bottom left.</li>
            <li>On Overleaf, you can share your file with others. There is a chat at the top right as well as the edit history.</li>
            <li>If you highlight text in the source, matching text is also highlighted. This can be used to find previous code to use as reference or to replace all matching text.</li>
            <li>If you click on the drop arrow next to "Recompile", you'll see that there's an option to autocompile. Up to you if you want this or not. There's also other options, such as checking syntax before compiling and faster compilation at the cost of some quality.</li>
            <li><b>Other helpful commands:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>hrule (draws horizontal line)</li>
                <li>hline (draws horizontal line for tables)</li>
                <li>double slashback (new line)</li>
                <li>emph (italicizes non italicized text, unitalicizes italicized text)</li>
                <li>footnote</li>
