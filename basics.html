          <p>Overleaf (this is not a feature of LaTex itself) provides you with a variety of templates to use for a variety of different types of projects. Click <b>View All</b> to see even more.</p>
          <p>If you're unsure about what type of format you want or prefer to make your own, a "Blank Project" will give you the framework for a very simple document.</p>

          <p>The first line defines the <b>type of document</b>; within the preceding brackets <b>font size</b> (in pt) and <b>paper size</b> (a4paper, legalpaper, and letterpaper) can be adjusted as well. The default font size is 10pt and the default paper size is letterpaper (8.5' x 11').</p>
          <p>The second line defines the <b>encoding. In general, don't touch this</b>. In the lines after, <b>import the packages you are going to use</b>. If you plan on using images use the "graphicx" package and provide a graphics path if you plan to have the images in sub-directories.</p>
          <p>The lines after package imports are used to define the title, author, and date. The "thanks" commands can be used to include names of those who helped in footnotes. The "today" command will update the date to the current date each time the document is compiled.</p>
          <p>To start printing words on the document, begin a "document" environment; use the <b>"maketitle"</b> command to print the title, author, and date, and the <b>"tableofcontents"</b> command to create a table of contents which automatically updates each time you recompile.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you may make an <b>abstract</b>, which is used to introduce or briefly overview the main topic of the paper.</p>

          <p>To incorporate images in your documents, use the package <b>graphicx</b> and upload the images to Overleaf.</p>
          <p>Click the triple dots to the right of your main.tex. You can upload from your computer files or import from any other existing Overleaf project you have.</p>
          <p>Use the command <b>graphicspath</b> to specify the folder of your images. If your images are on the root level, you do not need to use this command.</p>
          <p>The basic command for using an image is</p>

          <p>The first image to use a caption will be captioned "Figure 1:", followed by your text. Each following image with a caption will increment in its figure number by one.</p>
          <p>With the <b>label</b> command, you can assign an image a name to refer to its figure number easily. In addition to helping you and readers to quickly find an image, this also helps if the figure number changes frequently (due to adding images before it).</p>

          <p>Figure 2 also uses some other environments to format. This text is wrapped around the image using the <b>wrapfig</b> package. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Ut purus elit, vestibulum ut, placerat ac, adipiscing vitae, felis.<p>
