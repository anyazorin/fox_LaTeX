          <p>Overleaf (this is not a feature of LaTex itself) provides you with a variety of templates to use for a variety of different types of projects. Click <b>View All</b> to see even more.</p>
          <p>If you're unsure about what type of format you want or prefer to make your own, a "Blank Project" will give you the framework for a very simple document.</p>

        <h3>Document Formatting, Title, and Table of Contents</h3>
        <img src="images/TitlePage.png">
        <div class="body_p">
          <p>The first line defines the <b>type of document</b>; within the preceding brackets <b>font size</b> (in pt) and <b>paper size</b> (a4paper, legalpaper, and letterpaper) can be adjusted as well. The default font size is 10pt and the default paper size is letterpaper (8.5' x 11').</p>
          <p>The second line defines the <b>encoding. In general, don't touch this</b>. In the lines after, <b>import the packages you are going to use</b>. If you plan on using images use the "graphicx" package and provide a graphics path if you plan to have the images in sub-directories.</p>
          <p>The lines after package imports are used to define the title, author, and date. The "thanks" commands can be used to include names of those who helped in footnotes. The "today" command will update the date to the current date each time the document is compiled.</p>
          <p>To start printing words on the document, begin a "document" environment; use the <b>"maketitle"</b> command to print the title, author, and date, and the <b>"tableofcontents"</b> command to create a table of contents which automatically updates each time you recompile.</p>
          <p>Additionally, you may make an <b>abstract</b>, which is used to introduce or briefly overview the main topic of the paper.</p>
