                LaTeX is a typesetting language most often used for technical orscientific documents, usually of an academic nature.
                It takes plain text and creates stylized documents using tags in asimilar way to HTML/CSS.

                Leslie Lamport developed LaTeX in 1985. LaTeX evolved from TeX,originally developed by Donald Knuth in the late 1970s.
                Donald Knuth was working on publishing a book and was frustratedwith the typesetting process. He thought that he could just learn todo this himself, and write a program that would produce a betterquality document than what the publishing company was offering.
                He estimated the project would take about 6 months, it ended uptaking about 10 years. While TeX gained attention since it worked onany computer and operating system, was free, and would alwaysgenerate the same document.

                LaTeX heavily relies on TeX macros
                Macros (macroinstructions) are basically small code generatorswhich take a certain input in the code and upon compilation of thecode replace it with the preset output, which will later be run. Acommon example is:
                define square(x) ((x) * (x))
                n = square(5) which becomes...
                n = ((5) * (5))
                This allows LaTeX to have complicated tags that allow for things suchas bibliographies to be made with only one command.

                The most common use is typesetting documents with lots ofmathematical equations and code in them. There are also LaTeXadd-ins for powerpoints that also make writing equations simpler.
                The most basic way to use LaTeX is to download it, write a .tex fileand then compile it which would generate the document, there areeditors that make the process easier. One such editor is Overleaf.

                WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) is the main other form oftypesetting. Things like Microsoft Word and Google Docs areWYSIWYG editors.
                With LaTeX you don’t immediately see the results. You need tocompile it to see the change. Things like Overleaf make this rathereasy though.
                While LaTeX does provide a number of different output file types (DVI,PDF, HTML, XML), it also has restrictions in how much you can format.If one wants to control every aspect of the layout, have innumerablefonts, images, and other specifics, LaTeX is not the best choice. It isbest for clean, professional looking documents, so it does not allowfor too much creativity. If you prefer to have a very creative, colorfuland complex layout, LaTeX wouldn’t be able to do that.
                LaTeX does have a learning curve, but it takes about half an hour ifnot less to learn enough to properly use it. It is more efficient andeasier for equations and code, and will probably be useful in college.
